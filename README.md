# USCourse-IOS-Project-

## Summary
This project was created as the Final project of ITP 342. This app allows students to get an email notification when the course that they want to get notified has an availalbe space for them to register. What they need is their email address and the section number. For now, due to my lack of knowledge on how to run the backend even when the app is terminated, I implemented the backend functions in one of my view controller as completion handler.

## Technologies Used
* Objective-C
* AWS Amazon Cognito(Planning to use it to connect my backend and be able to run it when the app is terminated)
* SKPSMTPMessage API
* USC Course API
